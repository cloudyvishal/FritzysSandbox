<p>Our groomers are trained to carefully and gently express the anal glands when requested, to give relief to your cat.</p>
<p>What are the anal sacs and glands?</p>
<p>The anal sacs are a part of the cats skin. &nbsp;Sebaceous and sweat glands empty into each sac, secreting substances that play a role in both territory marking and social recognition. &nbsp;When a cat passes a stool, muscles around the anal sacs squeeze the sacs against the stool in the anal canal and empty a few drops of a liquid. &nbsp;If stools are soft, anal sacs may become impacted and their contents thick and pasty.</p>
<p>If the anal glands become impacted, the pet will need to be taken to a veterinarian.</p>
